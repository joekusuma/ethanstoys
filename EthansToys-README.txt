Test:
* Create a responsive web page using vanilla CSS using the PSD file attached.
* Maximum width of the content container will be what is shown in the mock-up file.
* The responsive design, below this max value, is completely up to you, we give you freedom to decide what is best for smaller screens.

Note:
* Assets included are images, and google fonts (or you can use google font links), however, the banner image in the PSD file has not been extracted, it will be up to you to create that asset via CSS or extract from the PSD file.

Main Requirements:
* On medium and large screens, the page will look like the mock-up.
* On smaller than medium screens, the page will adapt and respond however you think is best.

Delivery:
* Supply a link to the code in your personal GitHub.
    ** The more meaningful commits, the better.
* Supply a basic video showcasing the page in the browser.

You will have 2 hours to get as far as you can. This does not include setting up your workflow. If you cannot complete in 2 hours, that is totally fine. Just submit what you can in that time period.
